# BMO_Auth
.NET MVC with Identity

Custom controller is RegistrationsController.cs

The associated custom view is in Views/Registrations/Index.cshtml

No custom validation is included (just the use of date input fields to enforce formatting), but otherwise the custom view is fully functional

03 Sept -- fixed display formatting, all date prsing for create/edit views, and added validation/exception handling
